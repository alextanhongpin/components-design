#### Structure and Compositions

How should components be structured? It's best to structure them hierachically. I personally like the concept of __Atomic Design Pattern__.

The components, as well as the folder structure will have the following levels:

1. Atoms
2. Molecules
3. Organisms
4. Template
5. Pages

Back to school with the chemistry books, eh? So what does each level does?
