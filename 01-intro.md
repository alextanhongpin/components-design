#Introduction to Component Designs

### What are Components?
> Components are predictable elements that produces an **expected output** when a set of **known inputs** are introduced into them. 

E.g. A Twitter Tweetbox
** Known Inputs **: Are the initial states and user actions. In this case, a text with a maximum length of 140 characters, and a click action to submit the tweet.
** Expected Output **: A new tweet is created and added to the list.

### Custom tags

Custom tags are not part of the HTML tags that were proposed from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). For the full list (106 native tags), see [here](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp). With the rise of webcomponents, you can now create your own custom tags.

### Philosophy in Components Design

- Predictable
- Reusable
- Composable
- Accessible
- Usable
- Scalable
- Conventional

### Breakdown

Components have the following properties:
- Aesthetic (Describes the visual of a component, which varies according to the state)
- Structure & Composition (Describes how the components are structure and composed from atoms to organism)
- Behaviour & Actions (Describes the interaction between users and the components, and the expected outcome from the interaction)


#### Aesthetic

1. Components can be static or dynamic
** Static **: Meant for presentation only
** Dynamic **: User can interact with the component, and the components react according to the present states
